As part of our Web & Mobile II project at Rochester Institute of Technology Dubai, my colleagues and I designed and developed BookNest, a full-stack web application tailored for book enthusiasts.

BookNest offers users a seamless platform to:

- Browse books by genre and curated collections (e.g., New Releases and Thrillers You Must Read)

- Explore a dedicated section for Nobel Prize-winning authors, with details like notable speeches and fun literary facts

- Add books to various reading lists, add reviews and ratings, and track their reading journey

- Subscribe to a weekly newsletter with updates on new titles and featured content

Technology stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, Mustache templates

- Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA

- Database: MySQL (MariaDB)

- Version Control: Git and GitHub
